# History-Component
Build a HISTORY component:
- The history component works something like how a breadcrumb works.
- In the HTML, you will see "Locations" and "History".
- What is currently showing in the "History" section is just an example of the output. 
- That particular output was generated by the user clicking on "Sydney", "Melbourne" and then "Perth"
- You need to delete that history section's contents (the example output) and make the HISTORY component come to life.
- You may write/rewrite any of the HTML/JS/CSS as you like

Functional requirements:
- Clicking on any of the "Location" items will add that item to the "History" at the end.
- The item does not get added to, if it is already in the History.
- Make a history “Home“. If we click on that, it will remove all history.
- When we click on a history item, it will remove everything after (to the right of) that point.

Design Requirements:
- style the locations so it look like buttons

Rough estimate: 
- It should take roughly 1 hour to complete this task.
